# Hack The Box (HTB) Learning Journey

## Introduction
This space serves as a personal log growth in penetration testing.

## What I Learned
Through my Hack The Box journey, I have developed and sharpened a range of technical skills and concepts, including but not limited to:

- **Enumeration**: Understanding the critical role of information gathering and using tools like Nmap, Gobuster, and various enumeration scripts to identify entry points.
- **Exploitation**: Identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, services, and operating systems, and leveraging these flaws to gain access.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Developing an in-depth understanding of Windows and Linux privilege escalation techniques, such as kernel exploits, misconfigurations, and credential harvesting.
- **Scripting and Automation**: Writing custom scripts to automate repetitive tasks, streamline enumeration, and create custom payloads.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Decompiling and analyzing binary files to understand their logic and uncover potential vulnerabilities.
- **Web Application Security**: Mastering web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and more.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Extracting valuable information, maintaining persistence, and pivoting to other network segments once initial access is gained.

## Structure of the Repository
This repository is organized to make it easy for readers to follow my progress and understand the logical flow of concepts and challenges. The structure is as follows:

- **Academy Notes**: Key concepts, personal notes, and exercises from HTB Academy courses.
- **Box Write-ups**: Detailed walk-throughs of HTB boxes I’ve completed, covering every stage from enumeration to post-exploitation.
- **Scripts & Tools**: Custom scripts, one-liners, and other resources I’ve created to aid in my learning process.
